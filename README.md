Here are the general steps you could follow to build the codebase for a bus transit agency to publish GTFS feeds to Google Maps based on real-time data from a mobile app via MQTT and Apache Kafka:

1. Define the data format: Determine the data format and structure of the real-time data being sent by the mobile app. You may need to use a protocol buffer like GTFS Realtime or define your own data schema.

2. Set up the data pipeline: Use Apache Kafka to set up a data pipeline that can receive the real-time data from the mobile app and forward it to the backend system responsible for generating the GTFS feeds. This pipeline should include components for data ingestion, storage, and processing.

3. Generate the GTFS feeds: Use a backend system like Node.js or Python to generate the GTFS feeds based on the real-time data received from the data pipeline. This system should read the data from the Kafka topics and convert it into the appropriate GTFS format.

4. Publish the GTFS feeds: Publish the GTFS feeds to the Google Transit Data Feed using the GTFS API. This can be done using any HTTP client library in your preferred programming language.

5. Monitor and maintain the system: Set up monitoring and alerting systems to detect any issues with the data pipeline or GTFS feed generation. Regularly review the data to ensure that it is accurate and up-to-date.

These are the basic steps involved in building a codebase for a bus transit agency to publish GTFS feeds to Google Maps based on real-time data from a mobile app via MQTT and Apache Kafka. However, this is a complex task and may require additional steps or considerations based on the specific requirements of your project. (ChatGPT)
