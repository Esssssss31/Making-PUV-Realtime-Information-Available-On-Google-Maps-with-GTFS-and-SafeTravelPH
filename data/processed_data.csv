# processed_data.csv contains processed data, and not a code or script. 
# It is possible that processed_data.csv was generated by running a script or program that processes raw data, such as data_processing.py.

# In general, a CSV file contains rows of data, with each row representing a record or observation, 
# and columns representing variables or attributes of the data. 
# The format of the CSV file will depend on the specific data being processed and the requirements of the downstream applications
# that will use the data.
